# Music Festival List

This application retrieves music festival data and displays them in a particular manner: 
at the top level, it shows the band record label, below that it lists out all bands under their management, and below that it displays which festivals they've attended, if any. All entries are sorted alphabetically.

For example:

```
Record Label 1
    Band X
        Omega Festival
    Band Y
Record Label 2
    Band A
        Alpha Festival
        Beta Festival
```
